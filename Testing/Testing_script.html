					<h1>Test script</h1>
				<p>Hi _______________, my name is Justin, and I'll be guiding you through this useability test. Before
				we begin, there are a few things that I would like to go over. First, we are trying to test the site,
				not you. If you can finish a task, it means that the site has failed, not you.</p>

				<p>I will ask that you try and think out loud as your going through this test. Talk about what your looking at, what your thinking, and what your trying to do. This will help us 
				decide if we need to make any changes to the site.</p>

				<p>It's very important that you give us your honest opinion. Don't worry about hurting our feelings, as we want to make this site better. In fact, I wasn't involved in the site that
				your are about to look at.</p>

				<p>Feel free to ask any questions you might have during the test. I'll make sure to answer all of them before you leave here today, but because we are trying to understand more about
				how	people use our web site, I might not be able to answer them right away.</p>

				<p>With your permission, I'm going to record this session so that we can review it later. Also, some of the developers are watching in another room. Before we continue, I'm going to
				get you to sign this release form giving us permission to record this session. Nobody out side of this organization will see the video.</p>

				<p>Ok, before we begin, I have a few quick questions for you.</p>

				<p>First of all,what's your occupation, what do you do for a living?</p>

				<p>How much time do you spend on the internet a week? What do you usually do?</p>

				<p>Ok, I think that we can start the useability test now. This is the site. What are your first thoughts? Who made this site? What is the purpose of this site? What would you do on
				this site?</p>

				<p>Ok, I have a few tasks that I'm going to ask you to do. Once again I'll ask that you try and think out loud as you go through them.</p>

				<p>Ok, that's it for the tasks. I want to thank you for helping us out. Before you go, did you have any last minute questions for us?</p>
