					<p>If nothing else, I learned that while people have no problem criticizing something, their less likely to say what they like about it. While I knew going in to
					the usability tests that their wasn't a very many issues with the site that I had picked, I was hoping to get a better understanding about what it was that made it
					a good site.</p>
					<p>What I would do differently from this site:</p>
					<ol>
						<li class="normal">One thing that caused confusion was having his skills listed on the about page. While the user did eventually find the skill, it did take a bit of navigation.</li>
						<li class="normal">One comment that some people made was that some of the text, such as &quot;let's get in touch&quot; on the main page, was hard to read. I think a little bolder color, such as the blue that he uses, would have solved this problem while still looking good.</li>
						<li class="normal">The page of his past work was long. I think that adding dates to get a better idea of when stuff happened would have helped a lot. In addition, he should add some ways to filter projects, such as by the skill that he used for each one.</li>
