				<h2>Task 1</h2>
				<p>The company that you work for is looking to make a website to expand its online presence. You've been put in charge of putting together a team to make the website. Currently you
				don't have anyone in house with web design skills, but you have been given a link to a portfolio of some one you are considering hiring for the position. The ideal candidate would have skills in designing custom graphics and interfaces, as well as technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP. Find out how which of these skills they claim to have.</p>
				
				<h2>Task 2</h2>
				<p>In the past, you made the mistake of hiring someone based only on what they said, and when they started working, you found out that they were nowhere as good as they said they
				were. This time around, you want to make sure that they can do what they said they can do. Find examples of their previous work, and find out what their role in it was.</p>
				
				<h2>Task 3</h2>
				<p>One of the your current developes said that they would be able to handle the back end of the website if you can get someone to work on the styling. As a result, you've decided to
				contact him about working on your website. How would you do this.</p>
