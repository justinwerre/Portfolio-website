				<h2>Usability testing as a thing</h2>
					<p>By far the most important and interesting thing that I learned is that you need to do usability testing. I'm used to more of a functional testing, does the program produce the
					expected outputs based on a specific set of inputs. But I can definitely see the value in usability testing. All the work that you put in to making sure that your website has the
					correct features and that they work as intended would go to waste if the users can't use the site correctly. And while not every user is the same, as a developer, we know how the
					system should work, where things are and how to use them. But that doesn't mean that a user that has never seen our website will. And if they can't use it, then you won't have any
					traffic, making your site useless.</p> 
					
				<h2>Testing often</h2>
					<p>Testing often is a concept that I am already familiar with from my programming experience. The idea that even if you only have one person to test your site, and that your
					better off doing more rounds of testing with fewer people then less rounds with more people makes a lot of sense to me. While more of a functional level of testing (making sure it
					produces the correct outputs), I have on many occasions found errors in my programs on the second or third round of testing that you miss on the first round, either because you
					were stuck on other problem, or they weren't apparent at first. And you want to test to make sure that the changes that you made are actually going to fix the problem, and that
					they haven't created additional problems.  </p>
					
				<h2>For my Project</h2>
					<p>It's clear that I'm going to have to do regular usability testing to ensure that people are going to be able to navigate and use my site. Even if the test is as simple as
					asking someone if they can find a particular page, getting others input on your work helps to make sure that your end up with a high quality product. As a developer, I'm likely to
					become blinded to issues from the simple fact that I have spent so much time working on the site, that I might not see that decisions that I have made don't make sense, or are
					confusing to the user.</p>
