					<h1>Week 3 documentation</h1>
				<h2>It's information hunting season</h2>
				<p>One thing that Krug mentions in chapter 4 that I really agree with is that &quot;users don't mind a lot of clicks as long as each click is painless and they have continued
				confidence that they're on the right track.&quot; At least for me, I'm used to having to do a lot of clicking to get some where, as that's how I set up my computers file system, with
				lots of depth. I usually don't have issues with websites that require a lot of clicking to navigate, until I can't or don't find what I'm looking for. When I can't find what I'm
				looking for, lots of clicking really starts to bother me. The idea with having a deep navigation is that each level gets more and more specific, until you find what your looking for.
				But if you mess up where you put stuff, or how you label content, then it becomes a nightmare to find anything, which quickly becomes frustrating.</p>
				
				<h2>There are way to many useless words in this heading</h2>
				<p>I'm not sure why, but I keep getting caught up on Krug's third law of usability, &quot;get rid of half the words on each page, then get rid of half of what's left.&quot; The
				reason I keep getting confused is because I keep thinking that he is talking about making the articles on the page shorter. I forget that he is really talking about happy talk and
				instructions, and in those cases it makes a lot of sense. I generally never bother to read the happy talk. For the most part, I use the same handful of sites, so I just skip over and
				don't notice the happy talk. And, as Krug points out, I rarely use instructions unless I really don't know what I'm doing.</p>
				
				<h2>Insert cleaver heading here</h2>
				<p>By far the most important chapter this week was chapter 6. Saying that the navigation on my site could use some work is an understatement, and the only thing that could use more
				TLC then the menu is the home page, but that's a problem for next week. I think that setting up a good navigation system is going to be the hardest part of making my website, and one
				of the most important. One thing that is in my favor, is that my site won't be content heavy, so figuring out what my headings are for the persistent navigation won't be that hard.
				What will be harder is getting the look and feel that I want.</p>
				<p>There are two things I already know that my site won't have, breadcrumbs and a search function. Krug makes a good argument for their use, and on a larger website, I would
				completely agree with their use. The reason I'm not going to use them is that I don't have enough depth, or content to make them worth wild. The purpose of breadcrumbs is to
				&quot;show you the path from the Home page ot where you are.&quot; But  on my site, with the exception of the documentation, their is only going to be one level beneath the home
				page. If I was going to have multiple levels then I could see the value in them, and would add them as a part of my site. The same thing applies to leaving out a search function,
				their just won't be enough content to search though to make it useful.</p>
