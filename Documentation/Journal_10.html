					<h1>Week 10 documentation</h1>
					
					<p>Chapter 1</p>
					<p>One of Hoekman's rules for creating good applications is quite simple:  a good application "has only those features that are absolutely necessary for users
					to complete the activity the application is meant to support." As far as rules go, it's a pretty good rule, and in theory, it should be relatively easy to
					follow. But in my experience, as limited as it is, it's pretty hard to follow. The problem is, as a developer, I see all sorts of cool things that an
					application can do. I often fall in to the trap of "I could add this one really cool thing". Sometimes you think of a really cool idea, and it turns in to a
					really neat and useful way to do something, and sometimes it just makes things more complicated. The hard part is finding that balance. Making sure that
					you're always looking at the application trying to find better or easier ways to accomplish a task, and that when you do add features, it's to make the users
					life easier, and not just because you think it would be really cool. If you can find that balance, then your users will end up with an application that not
					only makes their life easy, but has features that support what they are doing. You can always make a personal project to try making that one really cool
					feature.</p>
					
					<p>Chapter 2</p>
					<p>"What you do is evidence of why you do it." If I take away just one thing from this course, that quote will be that one thing. It's a completely different
					way of thinking then I am used to, focusing not on the specifics of what you are doing, but rather the overarching idea. To me, it's taking a step back and
					looking at the whole picture. The idea that what you do should support why you do it makes a lot of sense to me. It focuses your efforts to a single idea, and
					makes sure they support that idea. Going back to what I said about chapter one; understanding why you do what you do can help make sure that you are doing
					things for a reason, rather than just because you think it's cool.</p>

					<p>Chapter 3</p>
					<p>For me, the biggest take away from this chapter was to design to support a situation. While it's important that a user be able to understand and use the
					system, it's more important that you design the system according to the situation that they are in, such as being a doctor or a librarian, then their
					particular needs or whims. Understand what they need to do, and how your system fits in to those processes, and can help support them. Once you have that
					down, make use cases and task flow diagrams to get a better picture of how the system works. From my experience, I understand the importance of good use cases
					and task flow diagrams. Done correctly, they can make your life really easy. And while something is defiantly better than nothing, poorly done use cases are
					of little use.</p>
