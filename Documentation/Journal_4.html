					<h2>Welcome to the greatest website in the world!&trade;</h2>
					<p>I'm slowly coming to the realization of just how much I don't like doing anything with the word design in it. It's not hard for me to figure out why; there just aren't that many
					rules when it comes to design. Take for example two, of Krug's guidelines for getting the message across on the home page. He recommends using as much space as necessary, but don't
					use any more space than necessary; neither of which really helps to decide how much space I should use. I do understand that it is one of those fuzzy, it depends answers, but I'm
					not really good at doing that, at least when it comes to designing.</p>
					
					</p>At least I now have a good idea of what the home page is supposed to do, I just have to figure out how to make it clear what the site is. One nice thing that I don't have to
					worry about for this project is having the home page becoming a cluttered mess from everybody wanting to put something on it. And in some ways I have it really easy. Since my site
					will be so small I don't have to worry about things like trying to promote too many things. However, some things become even more critical since this is going to be my personal
					portfolio. Establishing credibility and trust is by far the most important thing that my home page will need to do, since it is representing me.</p>
					
					<h2>Pulling down the pull-down menu</h2>
					<p>As with most things in design, pull down menus can and have been improperly used. Some sites use them better than others, some shouldn't even touch them while some sites really
					take advantage of them. So they defiantly fall in to the list of stuff that needs to be tested. They really need to be looked at from the view point of &quot;Does this pull-down,
					with these items and this wording in this context on this page create a good experience for most people who are likely to use this site?&quot; Or maybe Krug is right and the
					disadvantages of pull down menus outweigh the advantages, and I'm just a pull down menu fan boy. Who knows.</p>
