					<h1>Week 2 documentation</h1>
				<h2>Thinking about things that make us think</h2>
				<p>After reading this chapter, even thought I haven't done any useability testing yet, I've already found problems with the way that I'm designing my website. And interestingly
				enough, I did one of the things that he mentions in the text; I didn't make it clear what is and what isn't clickable in my menu. While I would like to achieve a minimalistic look
				and feel to my website, I have to find ways to balance that against usability.</p> 
				
				<h2>Learning what I already knew</h2>
				<p>I think that the biggest supprise this week wasn't what I learned, but rather what I was made aware of but never thought about and did anyways. Chapter 2 was a real eye opener, 
				and I realized that I do all the things that he talked about when I use the web. When I'm looking for information, I skim to a place that looks like it is talking about what I want
				to know, and then I read the relevent parts. Or I'll guess on whether a link will take me where I want to go, because as Krug pointed out, “There's not much of a penalty for guessing
				wrong”.</p> 
				<p>The muddling  through things is a little more interesting. The thing with muddling through, is that most of the time, it's because you don't know any better, and thus don't know
				that you're using something in a way that wasn't intended. To me, once you know how something is supposed to work, you're probably going to start using it in it's intended method,
				assuming it was properly developed. I know that their are probably lots of things that I'm muddling through at the moment, but I'm just not aware of because I don't know any better.
				</p>
				
				<h2>The convention of not using conventions</h2>
				<p>If their has ever been something that I agreed with more then this, I can't think about it right now. Steve pointed out two facts about conventions, and he is right, in many ways
				they are your friend. Although I'd probably describe them as a best friend that for what ever reason, you don't like. At least as a developer. They are incredibly useful; much like 
				a chain restaurant or store, you can take one look at it and know right away what it is, what it does, and how to use it.  To quote Krug: &quot;...praise from peers, awards, and 
				high-profile job offers are rarely based on criteria like 'best use of conventions'&quot;. 
				And that right there is the problem with conventions. If all we cared about was the end user, every site would use the same conventions. But as a developer, we want our site to stand
				out from others sites. We want it to be new, unique, and exciting. The fact that prestige isn't related to using conventions just reinforces that idea. As a developer, I want to be
				known for what I make, for being able to make something new and revolutionary. I don't want be be known as a developer that can only recreate what other people have already made.</p>
				<p>I will concede that you can do some really cool stuff and still use conventions. Take a wheel for example. One basic idea, and people have found some really cool ways to use it.
				Cars, bikes, skateboards, rollerblades, they all use wheels, and yet somebody somewhere woke up one morning and though &quot;what if a put a wheel on a shoe?&quot;. </p>
