					<h1>Week 6 documentation</h1>
					
					<h2>The longest wizard ever</h2>
					<p>Of all the reading that we have done so far, I would say that this is by far the most interesting reading. Perhaps the most interesting is that &quot;we perceive, to a large
					extent,	what we expect to perceive.&quot; The impact that this can have on the web site is interesting. One of the best ways to destroy usability is to not have a consistent look
					and feel to	your page. The best example of this is moving the next and back buttons on the last page. Personally I've used forms where they did this, and you end up cycling between
					the last two pages for a bit until you realize what they did.</p>
					
					<h2>Putting content together</h2>
					<p>Of all the Gestalt principles, the proximity is probably the most important one for my website. Since their is a small gap between the four regions on my website, it will be
					important to show how they are related. The principle of similarity will be useful for this, since the regions are all boxes. All while my site won't have tones of pages, with lots
					of content, having a good structure for the content that I do have will be useful.</p>
					
					<p>This leads into one really annoying thing that a lot of sites do, demanding a specific format for input, especially when that format is unintuitive, such as credit cards or
					phone numbers with no spaces. From a usability standpoint, it's a horrible design, and their isn't much excuse for making users enter information in this method. From a developer
					standpoint, it's not that much work to give  users the ability to separate numbers using formating such as dashes or spaces, and then parse them out later. To me, a few more lines
					of code that the user never sees is well worth making their life easier.</p>
