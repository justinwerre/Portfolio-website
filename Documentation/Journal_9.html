					<h1>Week 9 documentation</h1>
					
					<p>Chapter 10</p>
					<p>The key thing that I learned from chapter 10 is to make it clear what you want the user to do. As they pointed out, problem solving is hard, and as a
					result, you should have the system solve problems for the user, rather than forcing the user to solve problems for the system. The system exists to make the
					users life easier, and as a result you should design computer systems to do as much work, such as calculations, as possible for the user.</p>
					
					<p>Chapter 11</p>
					<p>Once again, the key thing for me is making sure that you understand your user and what they want to do as much as possible when you design your system.
					With chapter 11, they focus on making your system matches as closely as possible not only what the user wants to do, but how they want to do it as well. This
					will reduce the amount of learning required on the user's behalf to use the system to its full potential. Other things that the system can do to make the
					learning curve as small as possible for the user is to make things consistent across the system, and to use terminology familiar to the user. This will have
					the benefit of reducing the amount of things about the system that the user has to learn, as well as meaning that when the user has learned how to do
					something in one part of the system, they know how to do that thing in all parts of the system.</p>
					
					<p>Chapter 12</p>
					<p>To me, chapter 12 came down to one simple thing; make the system as responsive as possible. As they mention in the book, responsiveness is the most
					important factor in user satisfaction. Even when you can accomplish a task right away, let the user know that you are working on it. Perhaps the best example
					of just how important this is when you click on an icon to start a program. You wait a few seconds, try again, and then you keep trying until it loads. Then
					it proceeds to load the five other copies of the program, just like you wanted. While I'm sure that there are many systems where this can happen, finding a
					better way to acknowledge that you got the request, and you're working on loading the program would go a good way to solving this problem, and making a lot of
					users very happy.</p>
