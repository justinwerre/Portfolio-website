					<h2>Chapter 4 Reading is unnatural</h2>
					<p>The most interesting thing about this chapter is learning that reading is unnatural, that we aren’t wired to read like we are wired to speak. Part of it is
					because I have spent so much time reading, that for me, reading just happens. And I have a hard time understanding how people can get by without being able to read.
					With that I mind, it becomes important to remember that not everyone will be as good at reading as I am (and some people will be better than me). Jeff Johnson made
					a series of recommendations about how to make reading easier, and to me, some are really obvious, such as don’t use tiny fonts, or place text on noisy background.
					While some of the suggestions I had never thought of before, such as having information buried repetition, or using centered text. At least with the centered text,
					it depends on when and where you are using it. I don’t see an issue using it for a single line, such as a heading, but as Jeff points out, using it for multiline
					text makes the text hard to read.</p>

					<h2>Chapter 5 Our color vision is limited</h2>
					<p>While I might find other chapters more interesting in terms of “that’s really cool”, chapter 5 is very important at it deals with one thing that I have really
					been having an issue with on my web site. For me, the hardest part about getting my website right is getting a color scheme that looks good. While I have slowly
					been getting the colors close to something that I am happy with, chapter 5 brought a few things to my attention that I need to keep in mind. Things like the fact
					that humans are designed to detect contrast and not absolute brightness, which means that the colors I use need to be sufficiently different. Another thing that I
					need to keep in mind is that separation affects the way we perceive colors, which may or may not have an effect on my site as it has for sections with a gap between
					each section. Besides the obvious don’t use colors that color blind people can’t see, I need to make sure that the colors that I use are distinguished by
					saturation, brightness, and hue, as well as using distinctive colors.</p>
					
					<h2>Chapter 6 Our peripheral vision is poor</h2>
					<p>Chapter 6 has a lot of good information about how our peripheral vision works, and things that we need to keep in mind when designing site. One thing that I
					really like about the design of my web site is that since everything is relatively tightly packed together in the center of the screen, I don’t have to worry as
					much about where the user is looking. With that said, it is defiantly something that I will keep in mind for future projects. I have used sites where their put
					error messages nowhere near where the error occurred, and it can be frustrating to have to hunt and find the error message.</p>
