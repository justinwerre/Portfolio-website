					<h1>Week 8 documentation</h1>
					
					<p>Chapter 7</p>
					<p>This was an interesting chapter, learning about how our memory works. I found it interesting that our short term memory isn't a store, as I keep wanting to
					think about memory in the same way as computers, with long term memory as a hard drive and short term as RAM. Of the various issues with people remembering
					stuff, dealing with long term memory is probably the most challenging, and something that I lucky don't have to deal with. The balancing act between settin
					password restrictions that will make a system secure, while making it easy for people to remember their passwords without having to write it down is defiantly
					difficult to do, as there is no right answer for every system.</p>
					
					<p>Chapter 8</p>
					<p>It's interesting how fast you start to see topics reappear. Chapter 8 was a reminder that I need to do two key things on my website: understand users
					goals, and use the scent of information to guide them to those goals. The biggest part of this is going to be making sure my menu titles are clear, so that
					people instantly know where they will go if they click them.</p>

					<p>Chapter 9</p>
					<p>The one thing that is starting to really bug me about this book, is that while it contains a lot of really useful information, the site that I am designing
					is too small in scope and features to make use of a lot of the advice.  For example, Chapter 9 talked about making authentication information easy to recall,
					and while it is good information to have, I don't have any authentication on my site. There was one bit of information that will come in handy for my site
					though, using visual cues to show users where they are.</p>
