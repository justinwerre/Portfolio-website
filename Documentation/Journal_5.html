					<h1>Week 5 documentation</h1>
					
					<h2>Give me all your information</h2>
						<p>While talking about the reservoir of good will, the one thing that I found that really annoys me is when sites ask for more info then they need. I completely agree with his
						email about the problems about asking for too much information. While I don't fall in to the category of people that will provide false information, at least for sites that I
						trust, I will leave a site if they start asking for too much information.</p> 
 
					<h2>Wheelchair ramps and websites</h2>
						<p>A lot of the stuff that Krug thought the text book is stuff that when you stop and think about it, it should be common sense. And the chapter on accessability is no different,
						although by now cascading style sheets are pretty common place. To me, the biggest things that stuck out to me,were Krug's arguments about why people don't like dealing with
						accessability: as the developer, it means that I have more work to do, although it could be argued that for the most part, if planed correctly, increasing accessability shouldn't
						increase the workload to much, and that I don't see why it should matter that much. This goes back to one of the arguments that Krug pointed out about people that tend to
						skeptical:</p>
	
						<blockquote>&quot;Since their world consists largely of able-bodied 26-year-olds, it's very hard for them to believe that a large percentage of the population actually needs help accessing the Web.&quot;</blockquote>

						<p>Of Krug's suggestions about how to improve accessability, using CSS and fixing the problems that confuse everybody are really obvious. The one suggestion that I really like is
						making the website accessable with out a mouse. While I'm sure that there is more to is then just being able to go through form fields by tabbing, being able to do that makes a
						huge difference, and is especially helpful for more advanced users, as it speeds up filling out forms. </p>
